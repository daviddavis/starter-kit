= Dot Files Starter

These are config files geared toward setting up a system for a beginner who
wants to use vim and/or tmux. They are meant to be basic and not have too many
opinions about how a system ought to be set up.

== Installation

  git clone https://github.com/SciMed/starter-kit.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  vim -c "BundleInstall"


== Environment

These configuration files have been tested on Mac OS X and Fedora.
