= Dot Files Starter

These are config files geared toward setting up a system for a beginner who
wants to use vim and/or tmux. They are meant to be basic and not have too many
opinions about how a system ought to be set up.

== Installation

  git clone https://github.com/SciMed/starter-kit.git ~/.dotfiles
  cd ~/.dotfiles
  rake install
  git submodule init
  git submodule update
  vim -c "BundleInstall"


== Environment

I am running on Mac OS X, but it will likely work on Linux as well.
